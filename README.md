## Stroke Recognition Platform

> Software Engineering Group Project - COMP - 8117 - University of Windsor


This project focuses on predicting the chances of having stroke from facial data by utilizing **CNN** (Convolutional Neural Network). 

The project is structured in two modules:

 1. Frontend: Cross platfrom mobile applications (Android & iOS) powered by Ionic 4
 2. Backend: Django backend consists of the REST APIs and Machine Learning Model integration to process image and provide prediction result
